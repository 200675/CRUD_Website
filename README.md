### (≧▽≦) About the website (≧▽≦)

This CRUD website was created on cloud9. There are various languages included in the 	files, such as html, css, javascript, php, and sql. The point of the website is to input information such as your favorite anime and genre, then some generic personal information. There is also a feature to search and see if anyone else inputed the same genre or anime as you. There is another survey above the survey just mentioned where you choose your top 5 anime. There is some javascript included with this where you will get a popup if you don't select 5 animes. This website was rather difficult to figure out, as there were some technical problems with the sql database not working as intended. Googling things sometimes was always necessary, as the author doesn't have the largest expanse of knowledge when it comes to languages other than html and css. While it is still technically a work in progress, I hope whoever reads this will help to improve it even more.
